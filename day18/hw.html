            <h2>nu pagazi</h2>
            <p>Nu, Pogodi! is a beloved Soviet/Russian animated series, a "Tom and Jerry-style" cartoon about the comical, often futile, chase between a mischievous, smoking Wolf and a clever, well-behaved Hare. The series debuted in 1969, with its name translating to "Well, Just You Wait!", and features the Wolf's repeated attempts to catch the Hare, which are usually thwarted by the Hare's quick thinking or the Wolf's own blunders. </p>
