More narrowly, it can describe a specific historical period between roughly 1750 and 1830 (the Classical Period), known for composers like Mozart, focusing on balance, elegance, and homophonic textures. It is often performed in concert halls, featuring elaborate compositions like symphonies and concertos by trained musicians who read from music notation.</p>

        <li>Written Tradition: Classical music is primarily a written tradition, supported by a sophisticated system of musical notation that allows composers to create complex pieces for others to perform.</li>
        <li>Complexity & Formality: It features complex harmonic organization and a focus on formal structures, such as symphonies, concertos, and sonatas.</li>
